	IMPLEMENTATION OF DFA's, 
	FOR KEYWORDS AND SYMBOLS , there are seperate DFAs..

	FOR IDENTIFIERS,
	-----------------

	PYTHON REGEX is USED :
	[A-Za-z0-9_]  ( letter or digit )
	[A-Za-z_] letter

=============================================================================

	DFA can also be implemented using graph theory. 
	like GRAPH is presented using dictionary graph = {A: [B,C], ....}
	Like we can go from A to B and C ( on desired inputs )
==============================================================================
BUT:

I used simple programmatic way to make DFAs to keep things simple and straight
